## Marketing Artisan Chocolate Products

### The Brief

Mansfield Producers Incorporated (MPI) supports and develops the growth and success of producers within and around the Mansfield Shire. It has a website to promote its membership and activities.

In addition to its website, the organisation needed an online shopping platform to:

- Showcase the range of products produced by members
- Provide members with an online platform to sell their products
- Promote the MPI brand
- Promote individual member brands

### The Solution

The Genesis theme framework was used together with the Infinity Pro child theme to build the wordpress site used as a platform. Then, the Woocommerce e-commerce plugin was used to add the online shop. A multi-vendor marketplace plugin created by WC Lovers was added to convert the Woocommerce site into a multi-vendor platform.

Individual shop owners were then added and additional functionality added to enable their specific requirements, such as weight-based shipping, to be met. A vendor guide was written and added to the vendor dashboard as a reference for store owners.

WordPress plugins were used to provide site optimisation, security and backups. In addition, specific plugins were installed to extend the e-commerce functionality.
