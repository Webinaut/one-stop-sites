## Traditional Barber Shop

[https://shearingshedmansfield.com.au/](https://shearingshedmansfield.com.au/)

### The Brief

The Shearing Shed is a traditional barber shop located in Mansfield, Victoria. It is a family business operated by the daughter and her father, assisted by her mother.

It was decided that the business needed a website to showcase its ambiance and the services it provides. Several barber websites were identified as examples of the look and feel the owner wished to achieve.

In addition, a booking calendar was required for use by the business operators.

### The Solution

Thesis theme together with the Classic Responsive skin was used and customised to achieve the look required, as well as a responsive, mobile-friendly layout.

A range of photos were taken by the web developer and post-processed. They are used to showcase the barber shop, both via a front page slider banner and a page gallery.

A booking plugin was installed to enable bookings to be added to an online calendar. Several plugins were used to simplify the booking dashboard and make it more user-friendly.

Plugins were also used for functional purposes such as a sitemap, security and backups.
