## Growing Hydroponic Tomatoes

### The Brief

Murphy Fresh and Tatura Fresh are amongst Australia’s most successful hydroponic tomato growing farms. The company had a ten-year-old website, created using an early content management system, called Silverstripe. It wished to replace it with a more contemporary Wordpress website.

Gravity Design were commissioned to create the graphic design for the website. This was provided as a series of distinct page templates, each page on the website featuring a different layout.

In addition, Murphy Fresh and Tatura Fresh wished to use the website for HR purposes, such as recruitment and staff induction.

### The Solution

Thesis theme together with the Classic Responsive skin was used as a “bare bones” platform on which to build individual page templates.

The designs provided by Gravity Design were translated into page templates using CSS Grid. They were extended to incorporate elements such as drone videos of each site.

Recruitment forms were built with conditional logic to enable screening of applicants for valid visas and other requirements. Four secure induction areas for employees and contractors were created with slide presentations, followed by induction questionnaires.

Plugins were also used for functional purposes such as a sitemap, security and backups.
