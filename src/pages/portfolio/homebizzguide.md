## Legitimate Home-Based Business Ideas

### The Brief

The Legitimate Home-Based Business was built as an authority site in response to the plethora of questionable sites in this area. It aimed to leverage the owner's extensive business training and experience.

It was planned in two stages:

1. Building content and SEO to generate traffic.
2. Monetising with Google Adwords

To generate traffic and high search engine rankings the site required "magnetic" content. In addition to the search engines, traffic needed to be generated from direct sources as well as social media.

### The Solution

Thesis theme together with a clean, minimalistic skin was used to achieve a professional look and responsive layout.

Specific elements added to the site to draw traffic included:

- A huge list of home business ideas
- A home business term glossary

Plugins were used for functional purposes such as a sitemap, security and backups.

### Main Features

- Theme customisation.
- CSS customisation.
- Content curation via RSS feeds from relevant sites
- Image editing, colours, typography
- Responsive design
- Google Analytics
- SEO
- Set up of Facebook, Google Plus and Pinterest pages to drive traffic to the site.
