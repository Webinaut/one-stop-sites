### Events, Functions, Restaurant and Bar Venue

[https://rangesmansfield.com.au/](https://rangesmansfield.com.au/)

### The Brief

Following the redevelopment of the Mansfield Golf Club clubhouse, the emphasis of the club’s business changed from a golf focus to a balance between golf on the one hand, and dining, functions and events on the other.

The primary target audiences of the dining, functions and events business were identified as:

- Diners – golf club members (both golfers and social members), Mansfield permanent locals, Mansfield Weekend locals, Mansfield regular visitors, Mansfield one-off visitors.
- Events patrons across the segments above.
- Functions organisers, ranging from business groups to wedding receptions, end of life celebrations and others.

### The Solution

The process started with a brand identity project together with Gravity Design, a graphic design company. As a result of this project it was decided to develop a separate brand for the dining, functions and events business. It was to be called “The Ranges”. The brand identity deliverables included a Style Guide with colour pallets, typography and wordmarks for both the Mansfield Golf Club and Ranges brands.

A Wordpress theme was identified that reflected the styling of the Style Guide as well as incorporating restaurant features such as menu layouts.

The Ranges business was already using a third party reservations service and an events booking service. So, these were integrated into The Ranges website so that visitors can book without having to leave the website.

Various forms were used for enquiries and employment applications.

The website was launched using the domain name “rangesmansfield.com.au”.
