## Beautiful High Country Golf Course

[https://mansfieldgolfclub.com.au](https://mansfieldgolfclub.com.au)

### The Brief

The golf club had a Wordpress website for many years. It was in need of a makeover and a responsive theme.

Also, the site has a diverse set of users with varied needs. The Golf Professional needs to be able to upload competition results for members to view. The executive needs a secure area to upload documents for board members to view and download. Visitors need to be able to see course details, book a tee time and hire equipment. And restaurant users need to see the latest menu and specials.

### The Solution

One of the premium Nexus themes was used for its more professional look and responsive layout. It was customised using CSS to adjust the layout to accomodate latest posts and header and footer widgets.

A variety of plugins were used to manage access to areas of the site, enable file previews and downloads, and provide security and backups.

### Main Features

- Theme customisation
- CSS front-end customisation
- Image editing, colours, typography
- Responsive design
- Google Analytics
- Integration of Micropower golf management system
- Development of Facebook apps to open website forms on the club's Facebook page
