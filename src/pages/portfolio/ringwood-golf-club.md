## Member-focused Golf Club

[https://ringwoodgolfclub.com.au](https://ringwoodgolfclub.com.au/)

### The Brief

The Ringwood Golf Club is a long-established golf club located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Its members play at the Ringwood Golf Course, a public golf course owned and operated by Maroondah Leisure, part of the local shire council.

The club has no pro shop or restaurant, so marketing to attract visitors was not required.

The club's website was outdated and its content was sparse.

Against this background, the primary purpose of the club's website is to cater for the needs of members (current and prospective) rather than marketing the golf course, pro shop or restaurant.

It was decided that the club needed to replace it's website with a Wordpress website to facilitate regular content updating by designated club members.

### The Solution

The process started with a visit to the club (and a round of golf) to ensure an understanding of the club's unique website needs.

Astra Pro theme was used and customised to ensure that the club's brand colours were adhered to. Given that the majority of members use mobile phones to access the website, close attention was paid to responsive design to ensure a mobile-friendly layout.

The development process was very professionally managed by the client committee through shared cloud speadsheets, image folders and content documents.

Numerous club photos were post-processed using Lightroom CC to make them suitable for website display. Document pdfs were uploaded and organised into document repository folders.

Gutenberg blocks (including advanced blocks like tabs) were used to ensure that useability was optimised.

Several plugins were used to display document repositories, photo galleries and the front page slider.

Plugins were also used for functional purposes such as a sitemap, security and backups.
