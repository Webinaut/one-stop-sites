## Custom Kitchens and Bathrooms

### The Brief

Paps Lane Kitchens is based on the banks of Lake Eildon, near Mansfield Victoria, with a beautiful view of Mount Buller. Kevin has been building bespoke kitchen and bathroom cabinetry for some time, but he wanted a website to showcase his design and construction work.

The website needed to be designed to showcase the visual appeal of his work as well as being organised to manage the large number of images effortlessly.

Kevin required content to be written for the site and a logo to be designed for use on the website as well as across his business.

### The Solution

Story theme, a sharp, modern, clean theme was used. It is ideal for design oriented websites, as it has a well-formatted front page slider and an advanced portfolio gallery. A plugin was used to create folders, collections and galleries to manage the WordPress Media Library and facilitate the creation of portfolio pages.

The new Wordpress site was developed on a staging domain until Paps Lane Kitchens was satisfied that it was ready to go live. Then, the staging site was cloned and installed on their existing hosting service.
