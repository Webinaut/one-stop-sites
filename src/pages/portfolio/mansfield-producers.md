## Promoting The Growth Of Local Producers

### The Brief

Mansfield Producers Incorporated (MPI) supports and develops the growth and success of producers within and around the Mansfield Shire as well as promoting and developing a thriving agri-tourism sector to enable visitors to the region to have an authentic food, wine, local produce, stay and play experience.

The organisation needed a website to:

- promote its benefits to prospective members
- showcase member producers and their produce
- enable online membership applications and accept payments
- promote and issue tickets for events

### The Solution

Thesis theme was used together with a skin designed to showcase the Mansfield region and its local producers, attract new MPI members and promote current members and their produce. It was customised using CSS to create a professional look and feel.

Wordpress plugins were used to provide site optimisation, security and backups. In addition, specific plugins were installed to promote and issue tickets for events, provide a producer grid as well as a membership application form linked to an online payment provider.

### Main Features

- Skin customisation
- CSS customisation
- Image editing, colours, typography
- Responsive design
- Google Analytics
- Plugin installation and customisation
- Site optimisation and SEO
