    <h2>Website Design and Development</h2>
    <p>I build responsive sites using the latest WordPress technologies.</p>
    <p>
      This could be from a blank canvas to a custom theme or customising an
      existing theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also build websites using Astro, a new and fast static site generator.
      It uses island architecture to run dynamic content.
    </p>
    <h2>E-commerce</h2>
    <p>
      Woocommerce was created by the developers of WordPress and it integrates
      well into a WordPress site. Woocommerce gives you a great deal of control
      over all aspects of your online store, including product, pricing and
      shipping options.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have extensive experience with customisation of Woocommerce sites. I can
      help you achieve outcomes like having both a retail and a wholesale
      version of your e-commerce store on a single website.
    </p>
    <h2>Website Hosting and Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
      One Stop Sites offers a complete website hosting service. I am happy to
      clone and install your existing site on our servers or establish a new
      site from scratch. This includes purchasing and hosting a domain for you,
      if that is required.
