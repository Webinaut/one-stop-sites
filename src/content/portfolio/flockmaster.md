### Promoting Transfer Printing Services

[http://flockmaster.com.au](http://flockmaster.com.au)

### The Brief

Flockmaster had a static, non-responsive HTML website for decades. It received very little traffic and did not portray a contemporary image for the company.

Having recently been awarded the agency for a new printing product, called Supacolour, Flockmaster needed a new website to showcase its impressive range of printing technologies.

### The Solution

A Nexus theme was used for its more professional look and responsive layout. It was intended for a completely different industry. It, therefore, required customisation to create a look and feel in keeping with the company's corporate identity.

To ensure that the existing website experienced no downtime, the new Wordpress site was developed on a staging domain until Flockmaster was satisfied that it was ready to go live. Then, the staging site was cloned and installed on their existing hosting service.

### Main Features

- Theme customisation
- CSS front-end customisation
- Image editing, colours, typography
- Creation of a composite front page image to render correctly on mobile devices
- Responsive design
- Google Analytics
- Wordpress and theme training for responsible staff
