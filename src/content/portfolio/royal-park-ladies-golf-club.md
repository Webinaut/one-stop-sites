### The Brief

Royal Park Golf Club is a long-established golf club located in Parkville, just north of the Melbourne CBD. Its members play at the Royal Park Golf Course, a public golf course owned by the City of Melbourne and operated by Greenspace Management.

The club operates alongside two other golf clubs - Royal Park Ladies Golf Club and Royal Park Veterans Golf Club. Both of these clubs have had websites for years, as has Royal Park Golf Course, whose website is run by the YMCA as part of their Active Melbourne contract.

Royal Park Golf Club had no website.

The club wished to acquire a website to grow it's membership and provide a service to current members.

### The Solution

Following a detailed briefing from club leadership, several website options were offered. These ranged from a simple HTML website to a fully-fledged Wordpress website with extensive functionality.

The club opted for a middle option comprising a Wordpress website covering all the essential golf club requirements. 

Astra Pro theme was used and customised to ensure that the club's brand colours were adhered to. Given that the majority of members use mobile phones to access the website, close attention was paid to responsive design to ensure a mobile-friendly layout.

Photographic content was provided by the club. Where appropriate photos were not available, stock photos were used.

The website has quickly established itself as number two in the Royal Park golf rankings, closely behind the YMCA website. It is hosted, supported and maintained by One Stop Sites. This includes hosting on a Litespeed server, regular backups and theme and plugin updates.
