### The Brief

Royal Park Ladies Golf Club is a ladies golf club located in Parkville, just north of the Melbourne CBD. Its members play at the Royal Park Golf Course, a public golf course owned by the City of Melbourne and operated by Greenspace Management.

The club operates alongside two other golf clubs - Royal Park Golf Club and Royal Park Veterans Golf Club. Both of these clubs have websites, as has Royal Park Golf Course, whose website is run by the YMCA as part of their Active Melbourne contract.

Royal Park Ladies Golf Club had a Joomla website which had not been maintained or upgraded for some time. It had stopped functioning for technical reasons.

The club wished to replace its website to grow it's membership and provide a service to current members.

### The Solution

The Joomla website was somewhat dated in terms of design and functionality. It was decided to replace it with one built using Astro, a modern web framework optimised for building fast, content-driven websites.

The content on the previous website focused on documents, rules and policies. After discussion about what visitors and members were looking for when using the website, it was decided to focus on user-orientated content. This includes both photographic and text content, such as membership information. Both were provided by the club.

The website is hosted, supported and maintained by One Stop Sites. This includes cloud hosting and content updates.
