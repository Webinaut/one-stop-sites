summary: The Strathbogie Flavours brand was created as part of the website
  development project. Prior to the launch of the new brand and website, the
  business had a plethora of somewhat disconnected brands, including Ripe
  Delight, Lake Nillacootie Farmhouse, Marraweeny Olives and Mount Buller Olive
  Oil. These brands were rationalised under the umbrella brand name “Strathbogie
  Flavours” and are now marketed on a single website, strathflavours.com.au.

## The Flavours Of The Strathbogie Ranges

[https://strathflavours.com.au/](https://strathflavours.com.au/)

### The Brief

Dijana Cane moved to a rural property located near the shores of Lake Nillacootie, close to Barjarg, Northeast Victoria, to retire. She found that the property had an abundance of blackberry bushes growing on it. So, she developed a tea made from dried blackberry leaves. In addition, she developed a range of herbs and spices.

These products were marketed under the brand name “Ripe Delight” on a website branded “Lake Nillacootie Farmhouse”. The website included a Woocommerce shop.

In addition, the family purchased an olive growing farm at Marraweeny, not far from Euroa. The Marraweeny olive products were marketed on a separate website called “Marraweeny Olives” under the brand name “Cheeky Cocky”.

Dijana wanted the Lake Nillacootie Farmhouse website to be replaced.

### The Solution

The process started with a branding workshop which identified the Strathbogie Ranges as a common provenance across products. In addition, the products are known for their simplicity and organic, natural production methods. Combining these attributes, together with the sensory marketing concept of “flavour”, led to the conception of the Strathbogie Flavours brand.

The website was built using Astra Theme and the Organic Store template. The Woocommerce store was enhanced, incorporating features such as table rate shipping and minimum purchase rules.
